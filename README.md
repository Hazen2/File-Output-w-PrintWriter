File-Output-w-PrintWriter
=========================

A simple program demonstrating the PrintWriter class. The user is prompted for 
a file name and how many friends they have.
A file will be created with the PrintWriter class.
A FOR loop will then repeat the number of times based on the user's number of friends.
With each loop, the user will be prompted to enter the name of a friend.
The friend will then be added to the filename.
Once the loop has ended, the output file will close.
